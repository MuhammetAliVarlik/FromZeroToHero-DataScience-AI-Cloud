    "NumPy is designed for fast and efficient numerical computing. Two key features that help boost performance are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vectorization:** Performing operations on entire arrays at once, instead of looping through elements one by one. This leverages optimized C code underneath.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Broadcasting:** A powerful mechanism that allows NumPy to perform arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes by \"stretching\" smaller arrays to match larger ones without making copies of data.\n",
