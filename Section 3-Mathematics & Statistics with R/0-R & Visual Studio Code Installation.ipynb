    "# R Installation and VS Code Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the R language, it must be installed on your computer.  \n",
    "VS Code cannot run R on its own, so you first need to install R and then integrate it with VS Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps will make it easier to write and run R scripts, and will also enable features like auto-completion and error checking.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Installing R\n",
    "\n",
    "* Download the version suitable for your operating system from the official R site: [CRAN R](https://cran.r-project.org/)  \n",
    "* During installation, **add R to your system PATH** (Windows usually does this automatically, but it’s still good to check in your system environment variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify the installation, run the following command in Terminal or CMD/PowerShell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "R --version\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "If you see the R version information, the installation was successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Installing VS Code\n",
    "\n",
    "* If VS Code is not installed: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Required Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the VS Code **Extensions** panel, install the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **R** (Author: REditorSupport) – R language support and syntax highlighting.\n",
    "2. **R Debugger** (Author: REditorSupport) – Debugging support for R scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Configuring VS Code for R\n",
    "\n",
    "### a) Terminal Settings\n",
    "\n",
    "* In VS Code, press **Ctrl + Shift + P** → search for `\"Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)\"`.\n",
    "* For Windows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "\"r.rterm.windows\": \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\R\\\\R-4.3.1\\\\bin\\\\R.exe\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* For Mac/Linux:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "\"r.rterm.mac\": \"/usr/local/bin/R\"\n",
    "\"r.rterm.linux\": \"/usr/bin/R\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### b) R Language Server\n",
    "\n",
    "* In VS Code, open **Terminal** → **New Terminal**.\n",
    "* Type `R` to start the R console.\n",
    "* In the R console, install the package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "install.packages(\"languageserver\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This package enables VS Code to provide auto-completion, error checking, and code analysis for R.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Running R Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a new file with the `.R` extension.\n",
    "* Open the terminal (**Ctrl + \\`**) and run R commands there.\n",
    "* Alternatively, select code lines and press **Ctrl + Enter** to run them directly in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Using R in Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, install the `IRkernel` package in R:\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "install.packages(\"IRkernel\")\n",
    "IRkernel::installspec()  # Registers R as a kernel in Jupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you don’t have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed, run in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install jupyterlab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Once installed, launch Jupyter with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "From the \"Select Kernel\" menu, choose **R** to run R code in `.ipynb` notebooks cell-by-cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you have: 'The kernel 'R' was not started as it is located in an insecure location 'c:\\ProgramData\\jupyter\\kernels\\ir\\kernel.json'.  \n",
    "Click here for further details, optionally update the setting jupyter.kernels.trusted to trust the kernel.' error, you need to open VSCode Settings.\n",
    "Then you need to search 'jupyter.kernels.trusted' and add 'C:\\ProgramData\\jupyter\\kernels\\ir\\kernel.json'.\n",
    "\n",
    "```"
