    "Following best practices and style guidelines like PEP 8 makes your Python code clean, readable, and maintainable.  \n",
    "Here are some key rules and tips that help improve your coding quality:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use consistent naming conventions: `snake_case` for variables and functions, `CamelCase` for classes, and `ALL_CAPS` for constants.  \n",
    "- Properly indent your code with 4 spaces to clearly show structure.  \n",
    "- Limit lines to 79 characters for better readability on all devices.  \n",
    "- Add docstrings to explain what your functions, classes, and modules do.  \n",
    "- Choose meaningful names so others understand your code easily.  \n",
    "- Avoid global variables to prevent bugs and side effects.  \n",
    "- Keep functions small and focused on one task.  \n",
    "- Handle errors explicitly with exceptions to avoid silent failures.  \n",
    "- Reduce deep nesting to make your code simpler to follow.  \n",
    "- Use list comprehensions for concise loops.  \n",
    "- Replace magic numbers with named constants for clarity.  \n",
    "- Use `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` to control script execution.  \n",
    "- Write unit tests to ensure your code works correctly.  \n",
    "- Use type hints for better readability and tooling support.  \n",
    "- Don’t repeat yourself—refactor repeated code into functions or classes.\n"
