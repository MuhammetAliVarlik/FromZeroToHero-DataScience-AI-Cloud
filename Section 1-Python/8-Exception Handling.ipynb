    "When running programs, sometimes errors happen — like dividing by zero or typing letters instead of numbers.  \n",
    "Python uses `try-except` blocks to catch these errors and handle them gracefully without crashing the program.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The `try` block contains code that might cause an error. If an error occurs, Python looks for a matching `except` block to run.  \n",
    "You can catch specific errors like `ZeroDivisionError` or `ValueError`, and even a general catch-all with `Exception`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the `else` block runs only if no error occurred, and the `finally` block runs no matter what, making it great for cleanup actions."
