    "SOLID is a set of five fundamental principles in object-oriented design that help create code that is easier to maintain, extend, and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle — A class should have only one reason to change.\n",
    "- **O**: Open/Closed Principle — Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.\n",
    "- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle — Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without breaking correctness.\n",
    "- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle — Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.\n",
    "- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle — Depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "These principles help you write flexible and robust code by reducing tight coupling and promoting separation of concerns.\n"
